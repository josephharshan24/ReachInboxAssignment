## Architecture Details
The architecture of ReachInbox is designed to ensure efficient email synchronization, fast search, and AI-powered features. The application follows a client-server architecture with the backend providing necessary APIs and the frontend displaying the data.

## Backend Architecture:
Node.js and Express.js: The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
IMAP: The backend connects to an IMAP server for email synchronization and retrieval.
Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is used for indexing and searching email content.
AI Integration: The backend uses an external AI model for email categorization and generating reply suggestions.
Slack/Webhook Integration: Sends real-time notifications of categorized emails and AI-generated replies to Slack or other webhooks.
## Frontend Architecture:
React.js: The frontend is built using React.js to provide an interactive UI.
API Integration: The frontend communicates with the backend using REST APIs for email synchronization, categorization, and search.
WebSocket: (If implemented) Real-time updates using WebSockets for email sync or reply suggestions.
## Feature Implementation
## 1. IMAP Email Synchronization:
The backend connects to the IMAP server using credentials provided in the .env file.
It syncs emails at regular intervals and fetches new emails as they arrive.
## 2. Elasticsearch Search:
Emails are indexed in Elasticsearch.
Users can search through their emails using the search functionality in the frontend, which queries Elasticsearch for relevant results.
## 3. AI-Powered Email Categorization:
Using AI, the backend automatically categorizes incoming emails (e.g., Personal, Work, Spam).
The AI model is invoked using a POST request to Hugging Faceâ€™s API, which categorizes the email content.
## 4. Slack/Webhook Integration:
When a new email is categorized, the backend sends the categorized email and an AI-generated reply to a specified Slack channel via a webhook.
This allows users to get instant notifications of categorized emails.
## 5. AI-Powered Reply Suggestions:
The backend uses AI models to generate reply suggestions based on the email content.
This helps users quickly respond to emails with appropriate replies.
